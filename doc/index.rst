Catkin Pip
==========

This `ROS`_ package allows using pure python package in ROS Systems, from catkin workspaces.

It was born from the need to interact with ROs from a pure python environment, along with pyros.
Therefore the multiple workflows enabled by catkin_pip are workflows used by pyros and its dependencies.
