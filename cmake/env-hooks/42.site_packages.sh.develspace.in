# For catkin it is simpler to do add site-packages to PYTHONPATH in _setup_util.py.in than us doing it from here...
# but until catkin does this by default, the proper way from outside catkin is probably a env-hook like this one

# Note : We should enable site-package only on devel space.
# Install space should behave like packages, everything in debian layout.

# We combine our build path (catkin_pip_env) with site-packages (pip default) location, before attempting to prepend to the python path
# Careful : echo is only possible if we are in a bash script (not used by env.sh)
#echo "Prepending @CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX@/@CATKIN_PIP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR@ to PYTHONPATH"

export PYTHONPATH=$("@CATKIN_PIP_SCRIPTS_PATH@/pythonpath_prepend.bash" "@CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX@/@CATKIN_PIP_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR@")
